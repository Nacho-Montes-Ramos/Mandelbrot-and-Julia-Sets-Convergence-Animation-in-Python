# Mandelbrot-and-Julia-Sets-Convergence-Animation-in-Python
his project generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot and Julia sets by iterating complex mappings on a 2D grid of points and studying their convergence behavior.  The code produces both static images and animated GIFs that show how the sets emerge as the number of iterations increases.
